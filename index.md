# About Me

I am a nonbinary Ravenclaw potterhead novelist, author of the blog [QuarantineOccasional.com](https://www.quarantineoccasional.com/), anarchsocialist, 7th grader and a massive techie. I am very interested in different forms of government, specifically ones that prioritize community over economy. I am an antifascist, police-abolitionist, and TommyInnit-stan. I love coding, hiking, Minecrafting, and snuggling with my cats.

### Online Safety: Please Do These to Keep Yourself Safe Online
* Use a VPN: I use ExpressVPN for it's military-grade encryption, and SurfSharkVPN for it's cheapness.

* Encrypt all of your passwords: A password like Bunny123! or P@ssword! is really easy for a hacker to break. A password like "BkpkUf9gmV~ie!$<>" will take 350,000 years to break. Google Chrome and iOS both offer automatic, encrypted password-generators whenever you sign up for something. ExpressVPN as well as other privacy softwares also offer encrpted password generation.

* Don't reuse passwords. If you use the same password for your email, iCloud, Stock Software, and computer, it will make it so that if someone hacks your computer, they know your password for everything else, too. Password reuse is one of the leading causes of getting hacked _everywhere._

* Use an AdBlocker. I use the Chrome extention _AdBlock: Best adblocker_, and it gets the job done. VPNs like SurfShark and Nord also offer adblockers for mobile devices and computers. The reason for blocking ads is because a lot of them are clickbait, and humans are very succeptible to "OOH SHINY LOW DEAL!"

* DON'T. ACCEPT. COOKIES. 99% of websites on the internet use cookies. (Not me, why would I want to steal your treats?) These can be for many reasons, including site functionality, however many websites sell your personal data. As a California resident, I have the right to opt-out of cookies. (If you use a VPN you can also use this feature, however check your state's cookie policy.) Websites _should_ offer this, but some do not. If you _don't_ see this, **don't use the website.** OR, opt-out of cookies through your browser, Chrome, Safari, and Edge offer this as well as other browsers. Go to your browser settings and find "cookies" or "cookie usage." Press "never accept cookies." Now, even if you accept cookies on a website, they will still be blocked.

* Be **_very_** careful with your passwords. It may _seem_ like a good idea to put all your passwords in a Google Doc or the "notes" section of your phone, but it really isn't.
